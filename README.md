# JS30 Sort Without Articles
Exercise 17 in WesBos' JavaScript30 tutorials. 

I paused this one to see if I could solve on my own. Unfortunately after about 3 hours of playing around I had some of the concepts there but no solution. Getting the list on the page was simple enough with the querySelector and InnerHTML methods just as we have done in previous exorcises. I had also gone down the route of RegEx and after scouring some tutorials I was able to come up with an extremely similar Regular Expression on my own. 
This is where I ultimately got stuck.. 

<i>How to use the RegEx that now found the Articles to sort the list but still display the articles..? </i>

I was mapping through the bands[] and then pushing the matched RegEx values through to a new [] which didn't do me much good as I needed to sort all bands not just ones with articles. 

This exorcise gave me a deeper understanding of how to use sort(). Being that we can implement alterations to the data we are sorting without changing the actual data.
